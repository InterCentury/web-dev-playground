# 🌐 Web Dev Playground

Welcome to **web-dev-playground** — my personal space for learning, experimenting, and growing in web development.

This repository is a living archive of my web dev journey. It contains practice files, experiments, notes, and small projects that I build while learning modern web technologies. Think of it as a sandbox where ideas are tested, mistakes are made, and skills are sharpened.

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

The main goal of this repo is **learning by doing**.

Instead of just watching tutorials or reading documentation, I actively write code, break things, fix them, and document what I learn. This helps me:
- Understand core concepts deeply
- Track my progress over time
- Build confidence through real practice
- Create a public learning log I can look back on

This is not a polished product repo — it’s a **playground**.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

Inside this repository, you may find:

- 📄 HTML practice files  
- 🎨 CSS layouts, experiments, and styling tests  
- ⚙️ JavaScript basics, DOM manipulation, and logic experiments  
- 🧪 Small demos and mini-projects  
- 📝 Notes, comments, and learning references  
- 🔁 Multiple iterations of the same idea as I improve

Some code may be rough or repetitive — that’s intentional and part of the learning process.

## 🛠️ Technologies (Growing)

Currently learning / experimenting with:

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)  

More tools and frameworks may be added later as I progress.

## 📈 Growth Mindset

This repository will evolve over time.
Early code may be simple, messy, or inefficient — later code will (hopefully) be cleaner, smarter, and more structured.

Progress matters more than perfection.

## 📌 Notes

- This repo is mainly for **practice and learning**
- Code structure may change frequently
- Feedback and suggestions are always welcome
